train_direct.py-----------Using direct optimizers

Files for MNIST and CIFAR-10 will be automatically downloaded. 

problems.py contains the problems experimented on and new problems could be incorporated into it

Inputs in the train/train_ori/train_direct.py:

  num_Epochs: Number of optimizer epochs 
  logging_period: Period for model saving
  evaluation_period: Validation period
  evaluation_epoch: Number of epochs for evaluation 
  problem: Name of the problem
  num_steps: Number of steps for the optimizer
