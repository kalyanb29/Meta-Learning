  Abstract                 = {Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) used in complex optimization domains usually need to perform a large number of fitness function evaluations in order to get near-optimal solutions. In real world application domains such as engineering design problems, such evaluations can be extremely computationally expensive. In some extreme cases there is no clear definition of the fitness function or the fitness function is too ambiguous to be deterministically evaluated. It is therefore common to estimate or approximate the fitness. A popular method is to construct a so-called surrogate or meta-model, which can simulate the behavior of the original fitness function, but can be evaluated much faster. An interesting trend is to use multiple surrogates to gain better performance in fitness approximation. In this chapter, an up-to-date survey of fitness approximation applied in evolutionary algorithms is presented. The main focus areas are the methods of fitness approximation, the working styles of fitness approximation, and the management of the approximation during the optimization process. To conclude, some open questions in this area are discussed.},

The essential backbone of our framework is an evolutionary algorithm coupled with a feasible sequential quadratic program- ming solver in the spirit of Lamarckian learning. We employ a trust-region approach for interleaving use of exact models for the objective and constraint functions with computationallycheap surrogate models during local search. In contrast to earlier work, we construct local surrogate models using radial basis functions motivated by the prin- ciple of transductive inference. Further, the present approach retains the intrinsic parallelism of evolutionary algorithms and can hence be readily implemented on grid computing infrastructures. Experimental results are presented for some benchmark test functions and an aerodynamic wing design problem to demonstrate that our algorithm converges to good designs on a limited computational budget.},

  Abstract                 = {Using surrogate models in evolutionary search provides an efficient means of handling today's complex applications plagued with increasing high-computational needs. Recent surrogate-assisted evolutionary frameworks have relied on the use of a variety of different modeling approaches to approximate the complex problem landscape. From these recent studies, one main research issue is with the choice of modeling scheme used, which has been found to affect the performance of evolutionary search significantly. Given that theoretical knowledge available for making a decision on an approximation model a priori is very much limited, this paper describes a generalization of surrogate-assisted evolutionary frameworks for optimization of problems with objectives and constraints that are computationally expensive to evaluate. The generalized evolutionary framework unifies diverse surrogate models synergistically in the evolutionary search. In particular, it focuses on attaining reliable search performance in the surrogate-assisted evolutionary framework by working on two major issues: 1) to mitigate the 'curse of uncertainty' robustly, and 2) to benefit from the 'bless of uncertainty.' The backbone of the generalized framework is a surrogate-assisted memetic algorithm that conducts simultaneous local searches using ensemble and smoothing surrogate models, with the aims of generating reliable fitness prediction and search improvements simultaneously. Empirical study on commonly used optimization benchmark problems indicates that the generalized framework is capable of attaining reliable, high quality, and efficient performance under a limited computational budget.

  Abstract                 = {It is not unusual that an approximate model is needed for fitness evaluation in evolutionary computation. In this case, the convergence properties of the evolutionary algorithm are unclear due to the approximation error of the model. In this paper, extensive empirical studies are carried out to investigate the convergence properties of an evolution strategy using an approximate fitness function on two benchmark problems. It is found that incorrect convergence will occur if the approximate model has false optima. To address this problem, individual- and generation-based evolution control are introduced and the resulting effects on the convergence properties are presented. A framework for managing approximate models in generation-based evolution control is proposed. This framework is well suited for parallel evolutionary optimization, which is able to guarantee the correct convergence of the evolutionary algorithm, as well as to reduce the computation cost as much as possible. Control of the evolution and updating of the approximate models are based on the estimated fidelity of the approximate model. Numerical results are presented for three test problems and for an aerodynamic design example},

  Abstract                 = {Evolutionary algorithms often have to solve optimization problems in the presence of a wide range of uncertainties. Generally, uncertainties in evolutionary computation can be divided into the following four categories. First, the fitness function is noisy. Second, the design variables and/or the environmental parameters may change after optimization, and the quality of the obtained optimal solution should be robust against environmental changes or deviations from the optimal point. Third, the fitness function is approximated, which means that the fitness function suffers from approximation errors. Fourth, the optimum of the problem to be solved changes over time and, thus, the optimizer should be able to track the optimum continuously. In all these cases, additional measures must be taken so that evolutionary algorithms are still able to work satisfactorily. This paper attempts to provide a comprehensive overview of the related work within a unified framework, which has been scattered in a variety of research areas. Existing approaches to addressing different uncertainties are presented and discussed, and the relationship between the different categories of uncertainties are investigated. Finally, topics for future research are suggested.},

  Abstract                 = {Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have received increasing interests both in the academy and industry. One main difficulty in applying EAs to real-world applications is that EAs usually need a large number of fitness evaluations before a satisfying result can be obtained. However, fitness evaluations are not always straightforward in many real-world applications. Either an explicit fitness function does not exist, or the evaluation of the fitness is computationally very expensive. In both cases, it is necessary to estimate the fitness function by constructing an approximate model. In this paper, a comprehensive survey of the research on fitness approximation in evolutionary computation is presented. Main issues like approximation levels, approximate model management schemes, model construction techniques are reviewed. To conclude, open questions and interesting issues in the field are discussed.},
