  Abstract                 = {Bagging predictors is a method for generating multiple versions of a predictor and using these to get an aggregated predictor. The aggregation averages over the versions when predicting a numerical outcome and does a plurality vote when predicting a class. The multiple versions are formed by making bootstrap replicates of the learning set and using these as new learning sets. Tests on real and simulated data sets using classification and regression trees and subset selection in linear regression show that bagging can give substantial gains in accuracy. The vital element is the instability of the prediction method. If perturbing the learning set can cause significant changes in the predictor constructed, then bagging can improve accuracy.},

  Abstract                 = {The custom in surrogate-based modeling of complex engineering problems is to fit one or more surrogate models and select the
 one surrogate model that performs best. In this paper, we extend the utility of an ensemble of surrogates to (1) identify
 regions of possible high errors at locations where predictions of surrogates widely differ, and (2) provide a more robust
 approximation approach. We explore the possibility of using the best surrogate or a weighted average surrogate model instead
 of individual surrogate models. The weights associated with each surrogate model are determined based on the errors in surrogates.
 We demonstrate the advantages of an ensemble of surrogates using analytical problems and one engineering problem. We show
 that for a single problem the choice of test surrogate can depend on the design of experiments.

  Abstract                 = {After conventional waterflood processes the residual oil in the reservoir remains as a discontinuous phase in the form of oil drops trapped by capillary forces and is likely to be around 70\% of the original oil in place (OOIP). The EOR method so-called alkaline-surfactant-polymer (ASP) flooding has proved to be effective in reducing the oil residual saturation in laboratory experiments and field projects through the reduction of interfacial tension and mobility ratio between oil and water phases. A critical step to make ASP floodings more effective is to find the optimal values of design variables that will maximize a given performance measure (e.g., net present value, cumulative oil recovery) considering a heterogeneous and multiphase petroleum reservoir. Previously reported works using reservoir numerical simulation have been limited to sensitivity analyses at core and field scale levels because the formal optimization problem includes computationally expensive objective function evaluations (field scale numerical simulations). This work presents a surrogate-based optimization methodology to overcome this shortcoming. The proposed approach estimates the optimal values for a set of design variables (e.g., slug size and concentration of the chemical agents) to maximize the cumulative oil recovery from a heterogeneous and multiphase petroleum reservoir subject to an ASP flooding. The surrogate-based optimization approach has been shown to be useful in the optimization of computationally expensive simulation-based models in the aerospace, automotive, and oil industries. In this work, we improve upon this approach along two directions: (i) using multiple surrogates for optimization, and (ii) incorporating an adaptive weighted average model of the individual surrogates. The cited approach involves the coupled execution of a global optimization algorithm and fast surrogates (i.e., based on Polynomial Regression, Kriging, Radial Basis Functions and a Weighted Average Model) constructed from field scale numerical simulation data. The global optimization program implements the DIRECT algorithm and the reservoir numerical simulations are conducted using the UTCHEM program from the University of Texas at Austin. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methodology is demonstrated using a field scale case study. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we present a novel surrogate-assisted evolutionary optimization framework for solving computationally expensive problems. The proposed framework uses computationally cheap hierarchical surrogate models constructed through online learning to replace the exact computationally expensive objective functions during evolutionary search. At the first level, the framework employs a data-parallel Gaussian process based global surrogate model to filter the evolutionary algorithm (EA) population of promising individuals. Subsequently, these potential individuals undergo a memetic search in the form of Lamarckian learning at the second level. The Lamarckian evolution involves a trust-region enabled gradient-based search strategy that employs radial basis function local surrogate models to accelerate convergence. Numerical results are presented on a series of benchmark test functions and on an aerodynamic shape design problem. The results obtained suggest that the proposed optimization framework converges to good designs on a limited computational budget. Furthermore, it is shown that the new algorithm gives significant savings in computational cost when compared to the traditional evolutionary algorithm and other surrogate assisted optimization frameworks.},
