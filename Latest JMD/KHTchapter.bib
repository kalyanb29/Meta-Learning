abstract="In many practical engineering design and other scientific optimization problems, the objective function is not given in closed form in terms of the design variables. Given the value of the design variables, the value of the objective function is obtained by some numerical analysis, such as structural analysis, fluidmechanic analysis, thermodynamic analysis, and so on. It may even be obtained by conducting a real (physical) experiment and taking direct measurements. Usually, these evaluations are considerably more time-consuming than evaluations of closed-form functions. In order to make the number of evaluations as few as possible, we may combine iterative search with meta-modeling. The objective function is modeled during optimization by fitting a function through the evaluated points. This model is then used to help predict the value of future search points, so that high performance regions of design space can be identified more rapidly. In this chapter, a survey of meta-modeling approaches and their suitability to specific problem contexts is given. The aspects of dimensionality, noise, expensiveness of evaluations and others, are related to choice of methods. For the multiobjective version of the meta-modeling problem, further aspects must be considered, such as how to define improvement in a Pareto approximation set, and how to model each objective function. The possibility of interactive methods combining meta-modeling with decision-making is also covered. Two example applications are included. One is a multiobjective biochemistry problem, involving instrument optimization; the other relates to seismic design in the reinforcement of cable-stayed bridges.",

abstract="Despite advances in computer capacity, the enormous computational cost of running complex engineering simulations makes it impractical to rely exclusively on simulation for the purpose of design optimization. To cut down the cost, surrogate models, also known as metamodels, are constructed from and then used in place of the actual simulation models. In this paper, we systematically compare four popular metamodelling techniques -- polynomial regression, multivariate adaptive regression splines, radial basis functions, and kriging -- based on multiple performance criteria using fourteen test problems representing different classes of problems. Our objective in this study is to investigate the advantages and disadvantages of these four metamodelling techniques using multiple criteria and multiple test problems rather than a single measure of merit and a single test problem.",

  Abstract                 = {The custom in surrogate-based modeling of complex engineering problems is to fit one or more surrogate models and select the
 one surrogate model that performs best. In this paper, we extend the utility of an ensemble of surrogates to (1) identify
 regions of possible high errors at locations where predictions of surrogates widely differ, and (2) provide a more robust
 approximation approach. We explore the possibility of using the best surrogate or a weighted average surrogate model instead
 of individual surrogate models. The weights associated with each surrogate model are determined based on the errors in surrogates.
 We demonstrate the advantages of an ensemble of surrogates using analytical problems and one engineering problem. We show
 that for a single problem the choice of test surrogate can depend on the design of experiments.

  Abstract                 = {After conventional waterflood processes the residual oil in the reservoir remains as a discontinuous phase in the form of oil drops trapped by capillary forces and is likely to be around 70\% of the original oil in place (OOIP). The EOR method so-called alkaline-surfactant-polymer (ASP) flooding has proved to be effective in reducing the oil residual saturation in laboratory experiments and field projects through the reduction of interfacial tension and mobility ratio between oil and water phases. A critical step to make ASP floodings more effective is to find the optimal values of design variables that will maximize a given performance measure (e.g., net present value, cumulative oil recovery) considering a heterogeneous and multiphase petroleum reservoir. Previously reported works using reservoir numerical simulation have been limited to sensitivity analyses at core and field scale levels because the formal optimization problem includes computationally expensive objective function evaluations (field scale numerical simulations). This work presents a surrogate-based optimization methodology to overcome this shortcoming. The proposed approach estimates the optimal values for a set of design variables (e.g., slug size and concentration of the chemical agents) to maximize the cumulative oil recovery from a heterogeneous and multiphase petroleum reservoir subject to an ASP flooding. The surrogate-based optimization approach has been shown to be useful in the optimization of computationally expensive simulation-based models in the aerospace, automotive, and oil industries. In this work, we improve upon this approach along two directions: (i) using multiple surrogates for optimization, and (ii) incorporating an adaptive weighted average model of the individual surrogates. The cited approach involves the coupled execution of a global optimization algorithm and fast surrogates (i.e., based on Polynomial Regression, Kriging, Radial Basis Functions and a Weighted Average Model) constructed from field scale numerical simulation data. The global optimization program implements the DIRECT algorithm and the reservoir numerical simulations are conducted using the UTCHEM program from the University of Texas at Austin. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methodology is demonstrated using a field scale case study. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The aggregation averages over the versions when predicting a numerical outcome and does a plurality vote when predicting a class. The multiple versions are formed by making bootstrap replicates of the learning set and using these as new learning sets. Tests on real and simulated data sets using classification and regression trees and subset selection in linear regression show that bagging can give substantial gains in accuracy. The vital element is the instability of the prediction method. If perturbing the learning set can cause significant changes in the predictor constructed, then bagging can improve accuracy.},
